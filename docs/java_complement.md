In Java, the `int` type is 32-bit, and it includes the sign. So the `~` operation on an integer operates on all 32 bits, not just the bits necessary to represent the positive number.

To illustrate, let's examine what's going on with numbers in binary. I'll use a smaller 8-bit example for clarity, but remember that in Java, `int` is actually 32 bits.

The number 16203 is represented in 16-bit binary as:

`0011 1111 1100 1011`

The number 49332 is represented in 16-bit binary as:

`1100 0000 0011 0100`

When we take the bitwise complement of 16203 (`~16203`), we get:

`1100 0000 0011 0100`

This is exactly equal to 49332. However, in Java, the `int` type is 32 bits, and these additional bits are also flipped when using the `~` operator. In other words, `~16203` in Java isn't 49332, it's a negative number, because the most significant bit in a 32-bit `int` is now 1 (which indicates a negative number in two's complement form).

To properly compare values with the aim of bitwise complement, we need to mask the result to only keep the 16 least significant bits. Here is how we can do it:

```java
    int original = 16203;
    int candidate = 49332;

    boolean result = candidate == (~original & 0xFFFF);

    System.out.println(result);  // Will print "true"
```

In this code, `& 0xFFFF` masks the 16 most significant bits to 0, effectively limiting the bitwise complement to a 16-bit number. Now your code should work as expected.
